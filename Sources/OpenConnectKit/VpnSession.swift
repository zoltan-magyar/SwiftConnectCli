/// Manages VPN connections using the OpenConnect protocol.
///
/// `VpnSession` provides a Swift-native API for establishing and managing
/// OpenConnect VPN connections. All C interop is handled internally, exposing
/// a clean, type-safe interface.
///
/// **Thread Safety**: All methods are thread-safe. Delegate methods may be invoked
/// on background threads - use `DispatchQueue.main.async` when updating UI.
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// class MyHandler: VpnSessionDelegate {
///     func vpnSession(_ session: VpnSession, didChangeStatus status: ConnectionStatus) {
///         print("Status: \(status)")
///     }
///
///     func vpnSession(_ session: VpnSession, requiresAuthentication form: AuthenticationForm) -> AuthenticationForm {
///         var filledForm = form
///         // Fill in authentication fields
///         return filledForm
///     }
///
///     func vpnSession(_ session: VpnSession, shouldAcceptCertificate info: CertificateInfo) -> Bool {
///         return true
///     }
/// }
///
/// let config = VpnConfiguration(serverURL: URL(string: "https://vpn.example.com")!)
/// let handler = MyHandler()
/// let session = VpnSession(configuration: config, delegate: handler)
/// try session.connect()
/// ```
public class VpnSession {
  // MARK: - Public Properties

  /// The configuration for this VPN session.
  public let configuration: VpnConfiguration

  /// The current connection status of the VPN session.
  ///
  /// This property provides detailed information about the connection state,
  /// including any errors that caused disconnection and progress messages
  /// during connection establishment.
  ///
  /// Use the delegate's `vpnSession(_:didChangeStatus:)` method to receive
  /// real-time updates when the status changes.
  public var connectionStatus: ConnectionStatus {
    return context?.status ?? .disconnected(error: nil)
  }

  /// The name of the network interface assigned to the VPN tunnel.
  ///
  /// This property returns the interface name (e.g., "tun0", "utun0") after
  /// the TUN device has been successfully set up. Returns `nil` before connection
  /// or if the TUN device hasn't been configured yet.
  ///
  /// **Important**: The interface name becomes available only when the connection
  /// status changes to `.connected`. During the `connect()` call, the TUN device
  /// setup happens asynchronously in a background thread. To access the interface
  /// name reliably, wait for the delegate to report `.connected` status.
  ///
  /// ## Example Usage
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// func vpnSession(_ session: VpnSession, didChangeStatus status: ConnectionStatus) {
  ///     if case .connected = status {
  ///         if let ifname = session.interfaceName {
  ///             print("Interface: \(ifname)")
  ///         }
  ///     }
  /// }
  /// ```

  // MARK: - Delegate Properties

  /// The primary delegate for connection lifecycle events.
  ///
  /// This delegate receives critical events including status changes,
  /// authentication requests, and certificate validation.
  ///
  /// **Required**: You must set this delegate to receive connection events
  /// and handle authentication. The delegate is not retained (weak reference)
  /// to prevent retain cycles.
  public weak var delegate: VpnSessionDelegate?

  /// Optional delegate for logging and statistics.
  ///
  /// Set this delegate if you want to receive log messages and traffic
  /// statistics. Unlike the primary delegate, this is optional and can
  /// be left unset if logging is not needed.
  ///
  /// The delegate is not retained (weak reference) to prevent retain cycles.

  /// 4. Sets up DTLS for the data channel
  ///

  /// throughout the connection process to report progress.
  ///
